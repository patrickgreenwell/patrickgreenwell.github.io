There has been a spur of growth in my neighborhood in the last couple years with lots of new housing going in just down the street.  These new buildings are all LEED certfied Green buildings and are filling in a desperate need for housing in Boston, but specifically in Allston-Brighton.   

While not exactly cheap, but you get all the luxuries: doorman, gym equipment, rooftop deck, in unit laundry, Private theater, etc.  The thing about these buildings though, is even though they're going in they've got tons of parking for each one.  Most of the bottom level is occupied by parking.

These new apartments are literally a minute or two at max to the nearest Green Line Stop.  So you might be asking yourself why do they need so much parking when they're so close to the Green Line?

I decided to take a look at the BRA's [Parking Requirements][https://www.municode.com/library/ma/boston/codes/redevelopment_authority?nodeId=ART51TA_TABLE_JALIGNEDIREPARE] for the Allston-Brighton to see how many spaces these places needed. Table J spells out the requirements for parking minimums here:

This seems like a significant underuse of the space here.  2 parking spaces for every unit, when most of these apartments are at most 2 bedroom?  Considering the proximity to Green Line stations you'd think the parking minimums would be significantly lower than if you were to build the same complex in Brigton Center or in Lower Allston which both have bus lines passing through them on a semi-frequent basis but aren't near a rapid transit line like the Green Line.

So with added density BRA is actually increasing parking space requirements, note how these numbers aren't based on FAR (Floor Area Ratio) or any ties to it like the non-neighborhood or specialized districts BRA has designated:

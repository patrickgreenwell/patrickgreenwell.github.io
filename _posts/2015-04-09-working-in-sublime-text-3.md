After diving in with [meteor.js]({%post_url 2015-04-01-starting-out-with-meteorjs%}) and some open source projects with [Code For Boston](https://github.com/davidlago/mbta-ninja)  I decided to upgrade from my default text editor I was using to something more robust.  I've been a fan of Notepad++ for quite a while but have yet to really expand into doing any semblance of proper coding with it.  After searching around and hearing recomendations from folks I settled on Sublime Text 3.  It's really robust, has a package management system that is quite expansive and has some intellisense that is expandable.  

I settled on ST3 over VIM, EMACS, or continuing to use N++ for a couple reasons:

1. The learning curve on ST3 seemed less steep than that of VI.
2. It seemed like less of a hassle than to get Notepad++ to be my editor for these projects.
3. There are a ton of great articles out there on how to get you up and running in ST3.

One of the bigest things everyone tells you to do when you first get Sublime is to install [package control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).  From then on you can hit `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`, type `Install Package` hit `Enter` and then you've got your list of all the packages you could want.

Need JS Linter integrated? `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`, `Install Package`, `JS Lint`

The best part is that it gives you a list of the source and ther version so you don't have to worry if you do want to go look at the readme or package description, or find settings you can add to the .user-settings file.

All in all I'm enjoying development with Sublime Text 3 right now, though I don't think it'll replace Visual Studio for my .Net development anytime soon, although it could be on [the horizon](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2014/08/12/develop-asp-net-vnext-applications-on-a-mac.aspx).

title: Working with Jekyll
---

I've been playing around with [Markdown] for quite a while but haven't really used it for much besides documenting a few things in email and/or on some wiki sites for my work. But the idea of easily blogging with it has crossed my mind, and it seemed like the natural way to do this would be to use something like markdown to quickly, write and parse something into HTML.  

After looking around, I found [Jekyll].  It's ruby based so it runs on github pages, which makes it super easy to write posts and edit directly in github.

I followed [this tutorial][JekyllTutorial] to write this first post as well as configuring the general setup of stuff on the site.

It's super easy and kinda nifty how it works.

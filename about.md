I'm Patrick, I'm a Software Dev Lead for [Experian Marketing Services][linkedIn].  I work on lots of things from platform APIs to UX pages.  I like working in C# and lately JS. Sometimes you'll see me at [Code For Boston] on Tuesdays at the Cambridge Innovation Center. I'm into city planning, transit, and space games. I dabbled a bit in [leaflet.js], angular, Asp.net WebAPI, as well as being a markdown enthusiast and all around science geek.

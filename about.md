I'm Patrick, I'm a Software Dev Lead for [Experian Marketing Services][linkedIn].  I work on APIs, UX pages, and more.  I like working in C# and some JS frameworks. Sometimes you'll see me at [Code For Boston] on Tuesdays at the Cambridge Innovation Center. I'm also a city design, transit, and enthusiast. I dabbled a bit in [Meteor.js], [leaflet.js], [AngularJS], as well as posting here from time to time.
